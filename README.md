# Overview of Natural Language Processing(NLP)

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is the sub-field of AI that is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages. Computers are great at working with structured data like spreadsheets and database tables. Language, however, is a tricky concept for computers. Text is unstructured in nature and loses its meaning when represented by zeros and ones (individual characters). As a result, throughout the history of Language AI, there has been a large focus on representing language in a structured manner so that it can more easily be used by computers. Moreover, Extracting Meaning from Text is Hard. The process of reading and understanding Text is very complex.

### Applications of Natural Language Processing

NLP is an integral part of everyday life and becoming more so as language technology is applied to diverse fields like retailing (for instance, in customer service chatbots) and medicine (interpreting or summarizing electronic health records). 

###### Conversational agents

Conversational agents such as Amazon's [Alexa](https://www.amazon.science/blog/alexa-ais-natural-language-understanding-papers-at-icassp-2022) and Apple's [Siri](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri) utilize NLP to listen to user queries and find answers. The most sophisticated such agents — such as GPT-3, which was recently opened for commercial applications — can generate sophisticated prose on a wide variety of topics as well as power chatbots that are capable of holding coherent conversations.

###### Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of classifying the emotional intent of text. Sentiment analysis is used to classify customer reviews on various online platforms as well as for niche applications like identifying signs of mental illness in online comments.

###### Machine translation

Machine translation automates translation between different languages. [Google Translate](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/recent-advances-in-google-translate.html) is perhaps the most famous mainstream application.

###### Named entity recognition

Named entity recognition aims to extract entities in a piece of text into predefined categories such as personal names, organizations, locations, and quantities. It is useful in applications such as summarizing news articles and combating disinformation.

### NLP Pipeline

###### Sentence Segmentation

The first step in the pipeline is to break the text apart into separate sentences. Coding a Sentence Segmentation model can be as simple as splitting apart sentences whenever there is a punctuation mark.
